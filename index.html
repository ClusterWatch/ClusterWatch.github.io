					Hello, if you're wondering what we're doing here, we are a game company, mainly focusing on free-roam games. <br>
					We will take other request games, but not all, because we, you know, are pretty small, as of right now. <br>
					<span class="pressstart2p" style="color: #FF0000">We are still getting started up, so you'll have to wait a while until any games actually come out. </span>
